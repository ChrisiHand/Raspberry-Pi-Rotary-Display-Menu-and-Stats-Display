<h1>Raspberry Pi Rotory Display Menu und Stats Display</h1>
<br>
<p>First you have to download the luma oled library form: https://luma-oled.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ and select the right display in your code, which you are using (Mine was SH1106)</p>
<p>The next step is to wire up the rotory encoder to the rigth pins. The default is 23 24 and 25 for the button.</p>
<p>If you run the scipt and press on the button the stats display should appeare. If you click another time you will com to the menu display. When you click "EXIT" you will come back to the black screen saver. If you click on a .js script it will run with pm2.</p>
<p>Now you should have a Raspberry Pi with a Rotory Display Menu and a Stats Display. Feel free to make Pull requests.</p>
